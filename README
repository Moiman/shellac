        Shellac 
-========================-


== What is it?

Shellac is a framework for building read-eval-print style shells.  
Shells are created by declaratively defining a set of shell commands
and an evaluation function.  Shellac supports multiple shell backends,
including a 'basic' backend which uses only Haskell IO primitives and
a full featured 'readline' backend based on the the Haskell readline
bindings found in the standard libraries.

This library attempts to allow users to write shells at a high level
and still enjoy the advanced features that may be avaliable from a
powerful line editiing package like readline.


== Why do I care?

Shellac takes care of much the muckety-muck of writing robust, 
feature-full shells so you don't have to.


== How is it licensed?

Shellac is avaliable under a BSD3 license.  See the LICENSE file for
details.

Be aware, however, that the GNU readline library itself is
licensed under the GPL.  If you wish to use the readline bindings,
your project will need to be GPL compatable.

Go here (http://directory.fsf.org/GNU/readline.html) for more information
about the readline library.


== How do I build it?

Shellac uses a Cabal build system.  The follwing commands
assumen you have a haskell interpreter in your system 
path named 'runhaskell'.  All commands are run from
this directory.

To install for the whole system:

runhaskell Setup.hs configure
runhaskell Setup.hs build
runhaskell Setup.hs install

To install for a single user:

runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/home/<username>
runhaskell Setup.hs build
runhaskell Setup.hs install --user

To build the API docs:

runhaskell Setup.hs haddock


== Why 'Shellac'?

I had to call it something.  And is starts with 'shell'.
