<h3>About Shellac</h3>
<p>
Shellac is a framework for building read-eval-print style shells.  
Shells are created by declaratively defining a set of shell commands
and an evaluation function.  Shellac supports multiple shell backends,
including a 'basic' backend which uses only Haskell IO primitives and
a full featured 'readline' backend based on the the Haskell readline
bindings found in the standard libraries.
</p>

<p>
This library attempts to allow users to write shells in a declarative
way and still enjoy the advanced features that may be available from a
powerful line editing package like readline.
</p>

<h3>License</h3>
<p>
Shellac is available under a BSD3 license.  See the
<a href="../LICENSE">LICENSE</a> file for details.
</p>

<p>
Be aware, however, that the GNU readline library itself is
licensed under the GPL.  If you wish to use the readline bindings,
your project will need to be GPL compatible.
</p>

<p>
Go to the
<a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">readline home page</a>
for more information about the readline library.
</p>

<h3>About portability</h3>
<p>
Currently, Shellac is GHC only.  The 0.5 release made significant
efforts toward portability by eliminating dependencies on the GHC
specific features GADTs and STM.  However, it still requires
existential types, multi-parameter type classes, functional
dependencies, preemptive concurrency support and the FFI.  Currently no
Haskell implementation other than GHC supports all these features.
